### Mach Eight Sample Project

## Challenge 

# Task
â€‹
The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.

__IMPORTANTE:__ The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2). All edge cases
should be handled appropriately. This is _not_ a closed book test. You are encouraged to reach out with any questions that you come across.

#### Ejemplo
**List**: [1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12]     
**Number**: 12
**return**: 
+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4


### BoilerPlate

-The boilerplate have to two files: `App.js` and `App.spec.js`. The solution of the challenge's into file: `App.js` and the Unit Test's into file:`App.spec.js`.

## Solution
- Time Complexity of Algorithm | Spatial Complexity
--|--
O(n)|O(1)


# Validate the algorithm
- First Step: You should clone the project: git clone https://github.com/careyesp95/challenge-MachEigh.git
- Second Step: You should install the dependencies with: npm install
- Third Step: If you want to validate the algorithm with: npm test
